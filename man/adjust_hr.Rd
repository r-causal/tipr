confounder}
\usage{
adjust_hr(
  effect,
  smd,
  outcome_association,
  verbose = TRUE,
  hr_correction = FALSE
)

adjust_hr_with_continuous(
  effect,
  smd,
  outcome_association,
  verbose = TRUE,
  hr_correction = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{effect}{Numeric positive value. Observed exposure - outcome hazard ratio.
This can be the point estimate, lower confidence bound, or upper
confidence bound.}

\item{smd}{Numeric. Estimated difference in scaled means between the
unmeasured confounder in the exposed population and unexposed population}

\item{outcome_association}{Numeric. Estimated association
between the unmeasured confounder and the outcome.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Indicates whether to print informative message.
Default: \code{TRUE}}

\item{hr_correction}{Logical. Indicates whether to use a correction factor.
The methods used for this function are based on relative risks. For rare
outcomes, a hazard ratio approximates a relative risk. For common outcomes,
a correction factor is needed. If you have a common outcome (>15\%),
set this to \code{TRUE}. Default: \code{FALSE}.}
