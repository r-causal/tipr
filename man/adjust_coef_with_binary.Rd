\title{Adjust an observed coefficient from a regression model with a binary
confounder}
\usage{
adjust_coef_with_binary(
  effect_observed,
  exposed_confounder_prev,
  unexposed_confounder_prev,
  confounder_outcome_effect,
  loglinear = FALSE,
  verbose = getOption("tipr.verbose", TRUE)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{effect_observed}{Numeric. Observed exposure - outcome effect from a
loglinear model. This can be the beta coefficient, the lower confidence
bound of the beta coefficient, or the upper confidence bound of the beta
coefficient.}

\item{exposed_confounder_prev}{Numeric between 0 and 1. Estimated prevalence
of the unmeasured confounder in the exposed population}

\item{unexposed_confounder_prev}{Numeric between 0 and 1. Estimated
prevalence of the unmeasured confounder in the unexposed population}

\item{confounder_outcome_effect}{Numeric. Estimated relationship between the
unmeasured confounder and the outcome.}

\item{loglinear}{Logical. Calculate the adjusted coefficient from a loglinear
model instead of a linear model (the default). When \code{loglinear = FALSE},
\code{adjust_coef_with_binary()} is equivalent to \code{adjust_coef()} where
\code{exposure_confounder_effect} is the difference in prevalences.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Indicates whether to print informative message.
Default: \code{TRUE}}
