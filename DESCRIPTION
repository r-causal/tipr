Description: The strength of evidence provided by epidemiological and observational 
            studies is inherently limited by the potential for unmeasured confounding. 
            We focus on three key quantities: the observed bound of the confidence 
            interval closest to the null, the relationship between an unmeasured 
            confounder and the outcome, for example a plausible residual effect 
            size for an unmeasured continuous or binary confounder, and the 
            relationship between an unmeasured confounder and the exposure, 
            for example a realistic mean difference or prevalence difference 
            for this hypothetical confounder between exposure groups. Building 
            on the methods put forth by Cornfield et al. (1959), Bross (1966), 
            Schlesselman (1978), Rosenbaum & Rubin (1983), Lin et al. (1998), 
            Lash et al. (2009), Rosenbaum (1986), Cinelli & Hazlett (2020), 
            VanderWeele & Ding (2017), and Ding & VanderWeele (2016), 
            we can use these quantities to assess how an unmeasured confounder
            may tip our result to insignificance.
