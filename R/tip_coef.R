#' Tip a linear model coefficient with a continuous confounder.
#'
#' choose one of the following, and the other will be estimated:
#' * `smd`
#' * `outcome_association`
#'
#' @param effect Numeric. Observed exposure - outcome effect from a regression
#'    model. This can be the beta coefficient, the lower confidence bound of
#'    the beta coefficient, or the upper confidence bound of the beta
#'    coefficient.
#' @param smd Numeric. Estimated scaled mean difference between the
#'    unmeasured confounder in the exposed population and unexposed population
#' @param outcome_association Numeric positive value. Estimated association
#'    between the unmeasured confounder and the outcome
#' @param verbose Logical. Indicates whether to print informative message.
#'    Default: `TRUE`
#'
#' @return Data frame.
#'
#' @examples
#' ## to estimate the association between an unmeasured confounder and outcome
#' ## needed to tip analysis
#' tip_coef(1.2, smd = -2)
#'
#' ## to estimate the number of unmeasured confounders specified needed to tip
#' ## the analysis
#' tip_coef(1.2, smd = -2, outcome_association = -0.05)
#'
#' ## Example with broom
#' if (requireNamespace("broom", quietly = TRUE) &&
